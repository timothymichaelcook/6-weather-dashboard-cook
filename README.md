## Description

The focus of this project was to get weather data using the OpenWeather API, with local storage being used to store data.
This webpage will take a user's input in the form of text, make a call to the open weather API and return the five day weather forecast for that city. 
The page displays the user's search results, days of week, descriptive weather icons, minimum/maximum values for temperature in fahrenheit, and previous searched cities below user input element.
