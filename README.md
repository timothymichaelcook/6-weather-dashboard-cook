## Description

The focus of this project was to get weather data using the OpenWeather API, with local storage being used to store data.
This webpage will take a user's input in the form of text, make a call to the open weather API and return the five day weather forecast for that city. The page displays the user's search results, days of week, descriptive weather icons and minumnim/maximum values for temperatures in fahrenheit.
